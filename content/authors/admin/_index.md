I am a first-year PhD student at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) under the supervision of Professor Shaogang Gong. My research aim is to answer the question: In what ways can large language models be optimally utilized to facilitate multimodal learning in fine-grained unsupervised domain adaptation and domain generalization? Consequently, I am deeply interested in generative models, multimodal, and domain generalization.

I am actively seeking Research Assistant opportunities to further my academic endeavors. Simultaneously, I'm passionate about the practical application of scientific research and am keen on transitioning to the industry to expand my expertise and perspective.
